`extensions/omo-dag/` holds the OmO Graph OpenChamber extension: a sandboxed
panel (`src/panel.ts`, `panel/index.html`) and a read-only local service
(`src/service.ts`) that builds the sub-agent graph from OmO's task store and
the session registry. It has its own `tsconfig.json` (DOM and Node), because
the panel runs in a browser iframe. It shares the root toolchain:
`npm run build` bundles it with esbuild (`npm run build:extension` alone), and
`npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint` and `npm test` cover it. The bundles
(`panel/main.js`, `service/main.js`) are gitignored but listed in the
package's `files`. See [extensions/omo-dag/README.md](../extensions/omo-dag/README.md).

## Testing

```bash
npm run typecheck
npm test
npm run build
```

`npm test` runs `test/*.test.ts` and `extensions/*/test/*.test.ts` under
Node's built-in test runner (`tsx --test`). The extension's
`connector-parity.test.ts` imports `ocIdFor` and `SessionRegistryEntry` from
`src/session-store.ts`. Changing session ids or registry fields therefore
means updating the extension in the same change. These tests are hermetic: they don't require a real `pi` or
`omo` binary on PATH, and use fixtures under `test/fixtures/` (fake RPC
processes, fake OmO endpoints, recorded tool-call payloads) to exercise the
adapter logic in isolation.

Keep new tests hermetic and free of fixed sleeps. If a test needs to wait on
an async state change (an RPC event, a process exit), subscribe to that
signal with a bounded timeout rather than polling or sleeping a fixed
duration.

## Smoke scripts

The scripts under `contrib/` drive a real agent process end to end and make
real model calls, so they cost tokens and are not run in CI:

| Script | Command | What it checks |
|---|---|---|
| `contrib/smoke.ts` | `npm run smoke` | End-to-end smoke against a real `pi` process: bootstrap probes, a full tool round, abort, rename, delete |
| `contrib/omo/omo-smoke.ts` | `npm run omo-smoke` | End-to-end smoke against a real `omo` process, including OmO-specific features (fork/revert/unrevert, subagents, approvals, shell, compaction). Runs in an isolated HOME and private state directory; see `contrib/omo/smoke/README.md`. |
| `contrib/probe.ts` | `npm run probe` | Dumps raw pi/OmO RPC events to a JSONL file for protocol inspection |
| `contrib/model-consistency.ts` | `npm run model-smoke` | Checks that model selection/resolution stays consistent across requests |
| `contrib/v2-smoke.ts` | `npm run v2-smoke` | Checks the OpenCode v2 API surface specifically |
| `contrib/replay/transcripts.ts` | `npm run replay` | Opens copies of real sessions in an isolated OpenChamber with headless Chrome, at phone and desktop sizes, and fails when a transcript renders no turn. No agent and no tokens; the data stays local. See `contrib/AGENTS.md`. |

`contrib/omo/smoke/` holds the shared smoke-test harness (`core.ts`,
`context.ts`, and the `checks/` modules loaded by
`contrib/omo/omo-smoke.ts`); see `contrib/omo/smoke/README.md` for how checks
are structured, the `--only` selector, and how to add a new check module.

OmO-specific maintainer tooling (deployment scripts, version-pin tracking,
and similar operational material that isn't part of the general smoke suite)
is expected to live under `contrib/omo/` going forward rather than at the
repository root or in `docs/`.

## Adding a feature that touches the OpenCode API

1. Check `docs/api-surface.md` for the route/event you're implementing and
   whether OpenChamber actually calls it.
2. Implement the v1 route in `routes-v1.ts` and the v2 route in
   `routes-v2.ts`; shared v2 message/session/event translation lives in `v2.ts`.
3. Add a unit test under `test/` using the existing RPC/HTTP fixtures rather
   than a real agent process.
4. If you're adding or renaming behavior tied to an environment variable,
   update `docs/configuration.md` in the same change.
5. If you changed what a route returns or which routes exist, update
   `docs/api-surface.md`.
